### Overview
In this case study, we will use a fictitious dataset from WarmeHands Incorporated. You are hired as a consultant to analyze the inventory data and provide insights into which items would be best for renewing or increasing inventory.

### Inventory Analysis
Inventory analysis is a management technique that can help you optimize inventory control. For instance, it can help you reduce storage expenses, item costs, and unused goods and to increase profit.

<b>Benefits of Inventory Analysis</b>
- Reduction of storage expenses
- Reduction of purchase cost
- Reduction of unused goods
- Helps to increase profit

### Important KPIs
<b>1. Revenue: </b> 
Revenue is the amount of money a company receives in exchange for its goods and services. The simplest way companies calculate revenue is by multiplying the total number of units sold by their selling price.

*Revenue = quantity of units sold x selling price*

<b>2. Cost of goods sold: </b>
Cost of goods sold, or COGS, refers to the cost of producing or acquiring products that a company sells in a determined period. It only accounts for production costs such as raw materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, excluding the cost of selling the product and transportation. 

For example, the COGS of a wooden chair for a traditional wooden chair-making company would be the price of wood, glue, finishers, and labor, but not the distribution of the product. So, our COGS for a wooden chair would be,

*Wooden Chair COGS = wood + glue + wood finishers + labor*

<b>3. Gross Profit: </b>
The gross profit is the amount resulting after subtracting costs associated with making or acquiring products. It is calculated by subtracting COGS from total revenue.

### Dataset
The WarmeHands dataset contains six tables, which provide information on the following:
- The ID code of the items (also referred to as 'SKU' or 'SKU-ID')
- Item descriptions
- Initial stock quantities
- Individual orders, including their respective quantities and dates
- The country of precedence for each order
- The price of each item"
